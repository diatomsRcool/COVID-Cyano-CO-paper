Starting in Python
1. Starting with COVID-19 Patients Summary Facts Table (LDS)

3. Filtered out under 18 years old

4. Separate patients according to high risk and low risk zip codes.

5. Filter out patients with comorbidities: Substance use disorder, Smoking, Organ transplant, Pregnancy, cardiovascular disease, stroke, diabetes, obesity

6. Use Chi Square test to see if demographics are independent of high risk and low risk to cyanobacteria exposure. Maybe will have to see if liver and kidney disease are balanced. These results will inform the propensity matching.
Sex appears to be close to balanced
Race and ethnicity are not balanced
Vaccination is not balanced
Treatment is balanced
Used t-test for age: age is balanced

7. COVID severity is transformed to binary
Mild is 0
Moderate, Severe, and Death is 1

8. Adding SDoH data:
Poverty (percent of residents in ZCTA that live at or below poverty line)
Access (number of MDs per 1000 people by county)

9. Removed “no matching concept” from Sex and “unknown” from race

10. Exported data table from Python for ingestion into R Studio

Moved to R
11. Decided to discretize age, poverty, and access

12. Reorganized race to include Latino, White, Black, and Other

13. Using MatchIt in R to do propensity matching
Using this guide https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/MatchIt/vignettes/MatchIt.html
Best matching method is exact
Using ATT estimand
Output kernel density plot to visualize improvement in matching

14. Matched on age category, race category, and sex

15. Used glm model and included vaccine status, poverty category and access category in the model
Output results table with Odds Ratio calculated
Output forest plot to visualize Odds Ratios
